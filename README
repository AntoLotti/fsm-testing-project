# Finite State Machine (FSM) Library Testing with Ceedling

This project focuses on testing a Finite State Machine (FSM) library using **Ceedling**, a build and test framework for C projects. The goal is to ensure the correctness and robustness of the FSM library through unit testing.

## Project Overview

### **Objective**
The purpose of this project is to:
1. Implement a Finite State Machine (FSM) library in C.
2. Write unit tests for the FSM library using Ceedling.
3. Validate the correctness of the FSM implementation through automated testing.

### **Key Components**
- **FSM Library**: A C library that implements a finite state machine with states, transitions, and events.
- **Unit Tests**: Test cases written to validate the behavior of the FSM library.
- **Ceedling**: A build and test framework used to automate the compilation and execution of unit tests.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Ruby**: Ceedling requires Ruby. Install it from [Ruby's official website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).
2. **Ceedling**: Install Ceedling using RubyGems:
   ```bash
   gem install ceedling
   ```
3. **C Compiler**: Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).

## Setting Up the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AntoLotti/fsm-testing-project.git
   cd fsm-testing-project
   ```
2. Install Ceedling dependencies:
   ```bash
   ceedling install
   ```
3. Verify the setup:
   ```bash
   ceedling version
   ```

## Running the Tests

To run the unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
ceedling test:all
```

This will:
1. Compile the FSM library and test files.
2. Execute all unit tests.
3. Generate a test report in the `build/test` directory.
